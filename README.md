# SiteApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.7 using json-server for backend .  It is responsive by nature and compatible with all the latest browsers and it is made universal app for server side rendering of the application. Unit tested for all services used. Keeping future scalability and future enhancements in mind, I have made use of lazyloading.
